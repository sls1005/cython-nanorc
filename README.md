This enables the syntax highlighting for [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) in the `nano` editor.
It works on files with `pyx`, `pxd` or `pxi` as file extensions.

### Note

+ Some of the keywords might not be usable in files of some particular file types (For example, `def` cannot be used in `.pxd` files), but are still highlighted.
